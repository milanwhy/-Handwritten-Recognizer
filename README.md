# Handwritten Recognizer

## Overview
**Handwritten Recognizer** Developed a robust handwritten recognition system using advanced machine learning techniques to convert handwritten text into digital format.
Designed and implemented a neural network model capable of recognizing and classifying various handwritten characters and digits.
Applied state-of-the-art image preprocessing and feature extraction methods to enhance accuracy and efficiency.

## Features
- **High Accuracy**: Recognizes handwritten text and digits with precision.
- **Optimized Performance**: Utilizes preprocessing for faster and efficient recognition.

## Files
- `abuse_detect.csv`: Contains sentences with labels indicating whether they are hate speech or not.
- `abusive_words.csv`: Contains a list of abusive words used for star marking in detected hate speech sentences.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- MNIST
- Matplotlib
